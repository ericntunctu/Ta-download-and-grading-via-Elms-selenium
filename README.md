Python + selenium + xlrd (Excel)</br>
This code is based on python and selenium. </br>
We used selenium to let you log into ELms. https://elms.umd.edu/, which is a website (university of maryland).</br>
If you were a Teaching assistant, you do not want to type your students score into Elms by your hand. The easiest way is to tpye your students score in your excel sheet. </br>
Combined with XLRD, we can let python read the excel sheet and use selenium to type scores for you.</br>

One file is for download and one file is for grading.
